# Vote-o-Scope

Don't know what or who to vote for? Vote-o-Scope lets you assemble
statements and collect positions to those statement from to-be-elected
representatives and parties.

Voters can then go through the statements, put in their own positions and
then see an overview of what party or representative matches best.
